# Results manifest — every headline claim → committed file

This maps each table/observation in the paper (`SEVA_v8.tex`, `SEVA_v8_supp.tex`) to the
committed result file(s) behind it. All detector runs are frozen and non-oracle; the corpus and
poison are hash-gated (see [HOW_TO_REPRODUCE.md](HOW_TO_REPRODUCE.md)).

## The two composite-collapse figures (distinct measurements)

The 10-signal composite is an **ablation**, not the detector. It collapses under adaptation in
two distinct, separately-measured senses:

- **42–72%** — cost of *ablating* the soft signals from the detector (L2/L3 tiers, swept across
  density). Source: the 9 `results/in_domain/` files (`L2.asr` / `L3.asr` fields).
- **49–57%** — composite under an attack that *neutralizes the soft feature values* at the
  frozen operating point (E-CAL-2). Source: `whitebox_attack_results/ecal2_s042.json`
  (`L2.b` / `c1_value_clean` / `c2_drop_term` = 53.6 / 48.8 / 56.8).

The geometric hard gate holds **0%** against both.

## Supplementary material

| Supplement table | Backed by |
|---|---|
| `tab:confL1` / `tab:confL23` — per-seed confusion matrices | the 9 `results/in_domain/` files (L1/L2/L3 `counts`) |
| `tab:percond` — per-condition rates + Wilson | the 9 in-domain files + `reproduction/result_hienc_ci.json` |
| `tab:tau` — calibrated thresholds | per-run `tau_L1/L2/L3` and the hard-gate τ (≈0.84) in the result files |
| `tab:caps` — deployment-capability comparison | factual properties per cited defense (no lifted numbers) |

## The boundary: host-anchored cloning

The deployed gate's measured limitation (main paper, "The Boundary: Host-Anchored Cloning";
Limitations). Each injected passage mimics a *distinct* benign host, so cohesion never leaves
the clean band. Scored in the corpus the attack actually creates (95k clean + injected clones,
no templated poison present).

| Claim | Number | File |
|---|---|---|
| Clone evasion of `cluster_coh` (deployed gate) | **100%** of 50 targets; coh 0.751 vs tau 0.841 | `whitebox_attack_results/expD_deployed_gate_s042.json` |
| Retrievable @K=5 | 84% | same |
| Answer corruption among evading+retrieved | **31.0%** (13/42; Wilson 19.1-46.0) | same |
| **End-to-end ASR vs deployed gate** | **26.0%** of all 50 targets | same |
| CleanBase reproduced, matched 0.69% FPR | **100%** templated / **0%** clones -- identical to SEVA | `expT3_cleanbase_s042.json` |
| Payload-prominence frontier (Figure 1) | evasion 100->46%, retrievable 90->38%, **ASR peaks 28% at 25% payload** | `expT2b_potency_frontier_s042.json` |
| Complementary signal `s_nd` on clones | catches 13-20%; two-signal union gate 6.7-33.3% | `expA_snd_vs_paraclone_s042.json`, `expA2_cloneonly_s042.json` |
| Multiplicity sweep (1->5 clones/target) | coh 0.722 -> 0.790, still under tau | `expA2_cloneonly_s042.json` |

## Prevention, robustness, sensitivity

| Claim | Number | File |
|---|---|---|
| **End-to-end prevention (templated)** | corruption **18% -> 0%**; poison in top-K **2.74 -> 0.00** | `whitebox_attack_results/expA1_endtoend_s042.json` |
| K-sensitivity | **100% catch** at K = 3, 5, 10, 20 (recalibrated per K) | `expA23_sensitivity_s042.json` |
| Operating-point sweep | **100% catch** at FPR targets 0.1-5%; **AUC 0.99994** | same |
| Chunking + cross-encoder reranking | 168,865 chunks; clean/poison coh 0.752/0.991; **100% catch**; reranker moves 3.6 positions/query, poison@5 unchanged | `expS1_chunk_rerank_s042.json` |

**No cost-of-evasion claim is made.** Harmonized on one criterion and one generator: templated
undefended **18%**, templated with gate **0%**, host-anchored clones **26%**, prominence-optimal
clones **28%**. The bypass is at least as effective as the attack it replaces, and the gate does
not bind at the adversary's optimum (25% payload, where evasion is still 100%).

Attack generation used `mistral:7b-instruct` (temperature 0); the answer-corruption judge used
`gpt-oss:20b` (temperature 0), identical to the earlier `expC_potency_s042.json` run, so potency
figures stay comparable. Detection is LLM-free throughout.

## Notes

- `results/general_domain/` holds the **general-domain baseline** (WikiText-style background):
  there the soft signals look strong and the composite does *not* collapse (`L2.asr ≈ 0`) — this
  is the permissive-evaluation contrast that motivates the in-domain control.
- Large intermediate dumps (poison/paraphrase embeddings, retrieval squeezes) are **not**
  committed; they are regenerated deterministically by the scripts. Multi-GB embedding caches
  and FAISS indices are gitignored.
